- Island problem
    - Difficulty with fix: in interpolate_over_mesh we are going element by element and finding corresponding counties, so it seems that this actually has to be done in the data_to_compartments step (or actually, probably better in an additional step in interpolate_over_mesh before mesh is loaded)
        - or is there a sneaky way of putting it into the county overlap loading?
- Reporting interval problem
    - For now - added input smoothing in data_to_compartments. May not be the right solution though. Will viz first.
- DiscreteFunction problem
    - Need a way of loading data at each timestep into Sundance.
- Find original data paths for other files
    - Put them in the README
